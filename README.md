### My personal progress made during the following of the [Advanced CSS and Sass Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io).

ðŸ‘‰ This repo contains all the work I did whilst learning including my comments and documentation inputs.

The website design doesn't belong to me.
